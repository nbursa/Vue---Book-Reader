        <br/>Platform is (Probably) Wrong</p>
      <p class="quote">“A writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people.”
        <br/>
        <span class="Quoted">—Thomas Mann</span>
      </p>
      <p>If you’ve ever entertained the idea of publishing a book, then you’ve heard it:
        <em>You can’t get anywhere without a strong author platform</em>. Despite the tendency among newbie authors to dismiss such talk as propaganda, it’s 100 percent true. It’s true whether you’re self-publishing or trying to get that big publishing deal from a prestigious New York City house. No matter how wonderful your work is, without a strong author platform, you won’t sell very many books.</p>
      <p>The trouble is that too many inexperienced authors either don’t know this or refuse to believe it. Writing is the most over-mythologized profession in the world, and myths about publishing and quality versus marketing tend to pile up until most writers can’t see over the mountain of bullshit. These are some of the most common myths about platform, the ones that deal body blows to well-meaning authors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>If my book is great, platform doesn’t matter. </em>Since when does it not matter if a company can sell its product? Whether it’s just you or Random House, a publisher is a company and a book is its product, and products don’t sell if no one knows about them. Great as it is, Apple’s iPhone would have bombed without equally great marketing. So don’t kid yourself. Platform matters. A lot.
          <em> </em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Platform is about crass advertising and junk email. </em>Nope. Platform is about building a relationship with your readers. That’s why people buy books. With fiction, it’s because they feel they have a relationship with the characters. With nonfiction, that relationship is with you.</li>
        <li>
          <em>I can buy my way to a platform by paying for Twitter followers, email lists and the like. </em>See above. You can’t shortcut your way to meaningful relationships. Platform building takes time.</li>
        <li>
          <em>Building a platform costs a fortune</em>. It can cost a lot, especially if you waste your money on public relations firms that charge you $10,000 per month for no guaranteed results. But it doesn’t have to. The best platform tools—social networks (Facebook, Twitter), social media (blogs, podcasts, YouTube), and speaking—cost little or nothing. They just take knowhow and dedication.</li>
        <li>
          <em>I can build a platform in 30 days.</em>If you believe that, we have some beachfront property in Kansas with your name on it. Hordes of books, webinars, workshops and coaches promise that you can build your platform in a month. Sorry. You can lay the foundation of your platform in a month, sure. But the idea that you can set up a multi-part promotional and sales machine in 30 days is balderdash, and you certainly can’t build trusting relationships with readers in that amount of time.</li>
        <li>
          <em>I’d have to have my own radio show or an Oprah connection.</em>Literary agent Ted Weinstein says, “The seven most important words in book marketing are ‘It’s nice to see you again, Oprah.’” It’s funny, but it illustrates the power of celebrity and exposure. You don’t need those to be successful, not at the outset anyway. If you build a terrific platform, in time the celebrities and talk show hosts will come looking for
          <em>you</em>.</li>
        <li>
          <em>There’s a magic bullet.</em>Some authors delude themselves into thinking that a single perfect press release or Amazon review will rocket them to fame and fortune. While there are those rare authors who catch lightning in a bottle and enjoy quick success, they’re the exception. Remember, just because something
          <em>can</em> happen doesn’t mean it
          <em>will</em> happen to you. Most authors who make a living from their work do so slowly, step by step, by working their tails off.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you want to sell books and get published, the most important thing you can do as a writer is to clear your mind of those and any other myths about platform and marketing your work. To be a writer today is to be a marketer, full stop. Shed the notion that marketing is sleazy or mercenary. You’re not manipulating readers; you’re convincing them to give your work a chance in a market where about
        <em>two million</em> new books come out every year. A great platform:</p>
      <p class="callOut">Creates discoverability, interest, buzz and demand.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Discoverability</em> is the increased likelihood that somebody will stumble upon your book when surfing the Web or browsing a bookstore.
        <em>Interest</em> is capturing that somebody’s attention by teasing the cool stuff between your book’s covers.
        <em>Buzz</em> is turning one person’s interest into multiple “You have
        <em>got</em> to read this” messages that go viral. And
        <em>demand</em> is turning buzz into sales.</p>
      <p>None of that happens overnight, and it doesn’t happen because you hire someone to ghost-tweet for you or start your own blog. It happens because you do the right things again and again over time. Because while it’s never too early to start building your platform, it can most definitely be too late.</p>
      <p class="subA">Think Like a Buddhist</p>
      <p>Okay, but what exactly is an author platform? Your author platform is simply all the communication channels you use to make readers aware of your books and to develop and maintain your relationship with them. These are the main categories of tools that can make up a platform, in order of importance:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Author website</li>
        <li>Email</li>
        <li>Speaking engagements, book signings, and other events</li>
        <li>Social networks, which we define as communities of like-minded followers, including Pinterest, Instagram, Foursquare and so on.</li>
        <li>Social media, which we define as publishing with a social network component, like online videos that can be shared and commented on.</li>
        <li>Relationships with organizations such as corporations, nonprofits, universities, churches and professional/fraternal associations</li>
        <li>Relationships with influential individuals such as political leaders, celebrities, corporate executives, popular authors or media personalities</li>
        <li>Traditional media—radio, television and print</li>
        <li>Endorsements</li>
        <li>Internet publishing—online articles or columns</li>
        <li>Promotions and tie-ins, such as bookstore contests</li>
        <li>Advertising</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Your platform will almost certainly be built from the above boards, but which boards you use will depend on you. Some authors base their platform on social networking and blogging; others on speaking and radio interviews. It doesn’t matter what you use as long as you can manage it, enjoy doing it and use it to connect with your readers.</p>
      <p>Notice that we don’t mention
        <em>selling</em>? That’s because focusing on sales alone will doom you. To build a successful platform, you need to think like a Buddhist. Buddhism says that you can’t achieve something if you focus on the outcome. You can’t wake up tomorrow and proclaim, “I will lose ten pounds,” and have ten pounds vanish like magic. What you
        <em>can</em> do is take the right actions over and over, like working out and eating right. If you do, you’ll lose weight.</p>
      <p>Your author platform is the same way. You could slap down $1,500 for an email list, send out a few blasts and pray. Odds are, you’ll be wasting your money, because people don’t buy books based on an author’s sales pitch. They buy them because they trust the author. The relationship between you and your readers is built on a powerful implied promise: if they invest their time and money in your work, neither will be wasted.</p>
      <p>Successful authors earn that trust with a platform that touches people, connects over common ideas, shares exclusive material, and maintains two-way communication. If you do a great job of building that relationship, you’ll sell books. Pay no attention to the relationship and odds are you’ll wind up giving off that ugly “I’m entitled to have you buy my book” vibe that repels readers.</p>
      <p class="subA">Four Qualities Your Platform Needs</p>
      <p>Feeling disillusioned? Cheer up. We’re here to give you the straight story about what
        <em>does</em> work. Any author platform needs to possess four qualities in order to have any shot, so work on developing:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>Reach.</em> Through all of your platform components combined, do you have the potential to reach the number of readers that you’ll need to hit your sales goals? We’ll talk about how to calculate your reach later.</li>
        <li>
          <em>Diversification.</em> It’s terrific to have a big email list, but what if a virus sneaks into one of your email blasts and hosting companies ban you? Goodbye, platform. Have multiple components in your platform so that if one is slow, the others can chug away.</li>
        <li>
          <em>Non-sales outcomes.</em> Your platform doesn’t have to sell a book every time to be a winner. Every “touch”—post, speech, signing, handshake, website hit—is an opportunity to create a reader relationship. It might produce a sale, but it’s just as valuable to get a recommendation or review, capture an email address or social network follow, generate media coverage, or get someone to register for an event. </li>
        <li>
          <em>Sustainability.</em> You only have so much time and money. You don’t have time to blog four days a week and speak three times a month. Your platform must fit into your schedule and budget or you won’t follow through. Do what you can manage and don’t worry about the rest.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="subA">It’s About You</p>
      <p>In the end, building a great platform is all about you. You’re not selling a book. You’re building a relationship with readers that will, with luck, endure over the long term. You want readers to love how you think, get hooked on your turn of phrase, admire your personal story, and want to be part of your creative process.
        <em>You’re the product.</em> A book is you made portable.</p>
      <p>Authors who tell themselves that it’s all about the book become vulnerable to the
        <em>self-evident quality fallacy</em>:</p>
      <p class="Inset" style="margin-top:16px;">
        <strong>Author:</strong> “My novel is finally out!” </p>
      <p class="Inset">
        <strong>Reader:</strong> “Meh.”</p>
      <p class="Inset" style="margin-bottom:18px;">
        <strong>Author:</strong> “What? Why isn’t everyone flocking to buy?
        <br/>Can’t they see how wonderful it is? I certainly can!”</p>
      <p>Of course you think your work is terrific. We all think the same thing about our own work. That your book is worth buying is self-evident to you; you created it. But it’s not self-evident to anybody else. If you act like the sheer wonderfulness of your book is enough to generate sales, you’re screwed. You have to
        <em>make</em> people care enough to risk their time and money. You do that by connecting on a personal level.</p>
      <p>Don’t forget that if you’ve actually written a book and published it, you’ve done what millions of people only dream about. That makes you
        <em>magic</em>. Readers want to have a relationship with you. Let them.</p>
      <p>By the way, there are some book marketing gurus who get this; we’re not the only voices crying in the wilderness, and we need to give them credit. Tim Grahl, in particular, deserves mention. He’s knowledgeable and has used his savvy to help some legit authors get to the bestseller lists, including Daniel Pink. You can learn more about what he says about platform at
        <a href="http://TimGrahl.com">TimGrahl.com</a>.</p>
      <p class="subA">What About Good Writing?</p>
      <p>Of course, there’s a subculture of marketing-phobic writers who would rather not hear any of this. If you’re just finding your way back to this page because you angrily hurled this book across the room and scared the crap out of the cat, we get it. We just slaughtered that sacred writers’ cow that terrific writing is all you need. Well, to you and the others whom we may have offended, get over it.</p>
      <p>If selling books was about being a stellar prose stylist, plenty of bestselling authors would still be at their day jobs. Ever read
        <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>? How about the
        <em>Twilight </em>series? If you have, you know that the quality of the writing isn’t exactly Nobel caliber. So why have Dan Brown, Stephanie Meyer and other mediocre writers sold millions of books? Because, among other things, they created brands that resonated with their intended audiences and found publishers that marketed them brilliantly.</p>
      <p>Selling books is not about being a great writer; it’s about finding people who think your writing is great and are willing to pay for it. That’s an important distinction. Fiction that might put the average 50-year-old father of two to sleep might be irresistible to his eleven-year-old daughter. Is it easier to sell a book if you’re a crackling prose stylist who crafts marvelous dialogue? Sure. But there’s a laundry list of other factors that have as least as much to do with successful sales as stellar writing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The popularity of your genre</li>
        <li>Trends</li>
        <li>When your book comes out</li>
        <li>Your cover design</li>
        <li>Your title</li>
        <li>Blind luck</li>
        <li>Distribution</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Case in point: a few years back, Tim ghostwrote a book for Melissa Rivers, daughter of the late Joan Rivers and a legit writer, TV host and producer in her own right. Melissa signed her book deal with Random House while she and Joan were still hosting their famous pre-Oscar red carpet events, which were seen by billions, so the book,
        <em>Red Carpet Ready</em>, should have been a slam-dunk bestseller. But before it was even finished being written, Melissa and Joan were let go from their red carpet gig because they were too expensive. By the time the book came out, their incredible platform had evaporated and the book never got any traction. Despite being a really terrific book full of great stories and good advice, it flopped.</p>
      <p>That was nobody’s fault. It was circumstance. But sometimes, that’s what happens: you put in the labor, do your best work, and your book still doesn’t sell. But you keep pushing, because that’s what authors do. This is a tough racket. Years later, Melissa earned herself a bestseller with
        <em>The Book of Joan</em>, written after her mother’s tragic passing. That was good to see, a success richly deserved. </p>
      <p>Another case in point: Back in 2008, after president-elect Obama promised his kids that they would get a puppy once they moved into the White House, Naren’s company, Mascot Books, got to work on a children’s book starring the yet-to-be-revealed First Dog. Over the next few months, the book was written and illustrations were crafted (leaving out the renderings of the actual dog) about the first pet’s life in the White House. When word finally broke that the first family was getting a Portuguese water dog named Bo, finishing touches were put on
        <em>Bo, America’s Commander In Leash</em>, and the book hit the market within two weeks of Bo’s introduction to the world. Naren and his book appeared on ABCNews, MSNBC, USA Today, Inside Edition and others. Talk about timing!</p>
      <p class="subA">Crapload of Books? Really?</p>
      <p>Now, to the title. You’re savvy enough to know that we’re not guaranteeing that you’re going to sell 25,000, 50,000, or 100,000 books, or even a crapload of books, whatever that is (it just sounded fun). So what are we promising? Just that if you follow the advice in this book and create a strong, sustainable, diverse platform that’s focused on relationship building, selling a crapload of copies of a book over its lifetime is a realistic goal.</p>
      <p>So many writers become blinded by the idea of the bestseller that they lose sight of what they’re really trying to do: build a following of readers and sell enough books to achieve their creative and financial goals, whether that’s selling through the initial print run, gaining enough traction to justify working on a sequel or next book, or having enough income from your book to launch you into a full-time writing career. You don’t need to make the
        <em>New York Times </em>bestseller list to achieve your goals. It’s awesome if you can, but only a vanishingly small fraction of books ever do. If you think that’s validation that those books are good, we have four words for you:
        <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em>.</p>
      <p>Hitting a bestseller list doesn’t mean your book is well-written, and it doesn’t make it an automatic financial success, either. It just means you’ve sold a few thousand books in a single week. But the most successful books are the ones that sell steadily over time. If you want a real writing career and real success, don’t worry about short-term sales. Build a platform that will help your book sell consistently for ten or more years. That’s sustainable, long-term success that makes writing more than a vocation. It makes it a
        <em>life</em>. </p>
      <p>We hope the Secrets will channel your energy and enthusiasm for selling books, help keep you from making costly mistakes, and help you become a savvy, smart, aggressive book marketer. Because that’s what you have to be today.</p>
      <p>Enough chatter. Let’s do this.</p>
