      <p class="subheader">Platform Before Book…
        <br/>Way Before</p>
      <p class="quote">“You must cultivate a readership every day of your life, and you start TODAY. Your readers will not be interested in reading just one book; they will be interested in everything and anything you do—and that includes interacting with you online. Audience development doesn’t happen overnight (or even in 6 months or a year)—and it’s a process that continues for as long as you want to have a readership. It shouldn’t be delayed, postponed, or discounted for one minute.”
        <br/>
        <span class="Quoted">— Jane Friedman, Being Human at Electric Speed</span>
      </p>
      <p>A few years back Tim was working with ex-rapper, minister and reality personality Rev Run and action film star Tyrese Gibson on what would eventually become their book,
        <em>Manology</em>. Because of differences in what they thought the content should be he didn’t end up writing the book, but that’s not important for this story. What is important is that Tyrese had a Twitter following of more than three million people. It was a platform so powerful that when his book
        <em>How to Get Out of Your Own Way</em> fell off the
        <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list, he tweeted it back on by telling his followers to buy the book!</p>
      <p>But Tyrese didn’t accumulate those three million followers overnight. It took years of him tweeting ten, twenty, thirty times a day and responding to followers’ replies. Long before he was a bestselling author he was a Twitter star, and that’s the point. Tyrese didn’t wait until after his books were done—or even until they were being written—to start building his platform. By the time he went out looking for a book deal, publishers could see that he was a Twitter monster, a force to be reckoned with whose loyal fans would buy tens of thousands of books on his say-so.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>That brings us to Rule #1:</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="callOut">Start building your platform long before you publish your book.</p>
      <p class="subA">Planting Isn’t Harvesting</p>
      <p>The Secrets are guidelines for helping you master both the art and science of book marketing. Rather than tell you what to do, they’re about how to approach your author platform—mistakes to avoid, ways to channel your limited resources and so on. Use them as a sort of operating system for your marketing—always running under the surface, invisible but shaping everything you do.</p>
      <p>Do that and you’ll perform like a boss in the Four Seasons of Platform Development:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Season One:</em>
          <em>Till.</em> Start off by preparing the soil, getting ready, making sure you have your tools and all the stuff you’ll need.</li>
        <li>
          <em>Season Two: Plant.</em> Start seeding the world with content and messages from your blog, social networks and so on.</li>
        <li>
          <em>Season Three: Feed.</em> Just like with a crop, you’ve got to weed and feed your platform. You’ll create incentives and find allies.</li>
        <li>
          <em>Season Four: Harvest.</em> Your book’s almost out, and it’s all about promotions, coordination, pre-orders and media opportunities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are plenty of coaches and consultants out there who will tell you otherwise. They run seminars and sell books that insist you can build an author platform in just 30 days—a platform, by the way, that will propel you to fame and fortune. But that’s just nonsense.</p>
      <p>Is it possible to set up the components for your platform in 30 days? Sure it is. You can definitely create and launch a decent author website, launch accounts on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, start blogging and publishing articles on LinkedIn (if that’s your thing), begin scouting for speaking engagements, reach out to potential endorsers, and develop cool giveaway items like bookmarks, all in 30 days. No problem.</p>
      <p>But
        <em>setting up</em> your platform is not
        <em>building</em> your platform. It’s a lot like planting a garden. When you decide that you want tasty backyard tomatoes and zucchini, you prepare and till the soil, plant your seeds, water and fertilize. But you don’t kid yourself that you’ll be ready to harvest the next day. You’ve planted the seeds, but now you’ve got the wait for things to grow. That is, unless you want a mouthful of dirt.</p>
      <p class="subA">The Four C
        <span style="text-transform:none;">s</span>
      </p>
      <p>The author platform is the same way. Putting the tools in place is vital but it’s just the beginning. You’ve still got months or even years of dedicated, steady work ahead to build up an audience that trusts and likes you before you can harvest—er, start selling books or even sniff a book deal. A platform is a relationship with readers, and like all solid relationships it’s built on the two Ts:
        <em>trust</em> and
        <em>time</em>.</p>
      <p>Over the months, your potential readers will interact with you again and again. They’ll read your blog posts and Facebook updates. They’ll watch your YouTube videos and check out your articles in the local newspaper or on the Huffington Post. They’ll reply to your tweets and maybe even come to hear you speak. During all that time, they’ll be asking and answering questions about you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Can I trust this author to not waste my time?”</li>
        <li>“Is what he says relevant and valuable to me?”</li>
        <li>“Is he likable and approachable?”</li>
        <li>“Does he seem authentic or is he just trying to sell books?”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Over time, you’re hoping that potential readers answer those questions for themselves in the right way. So you keep writing and posting and speaking and responding to comments in an open, consistent and friendly way, and you slowly build trust. That’s when you convert potential readers into fans who care about you and what you have to say, and who will not only buy your books but also share them with others.</p>
      <p>Is there any way to shortcut that process in 30 days? Of course not. That would be like suggesting that you can speed up the process of two people falling in love. They can (and do) fall under the spell of infatuation in seconds, but that’s just another name for chemical lust. Real love takes time, constancy, trust and respect. So does a strong relationship between an author and an audience.</p>
      <p>In the end, you need time to build up the Four Cs:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Consistency. </strong>When you see advertising for Apple, McDonald’s or any other major brand, it’s always the same colors, slogan, and message, right? With consistency comes familiarity and comfort. Start thinking of your platform as an advertising campaign that promotes you and your book. Your messaging, key ideas, and brand identity should remain the same over time. For example, if you’ve written a historical romance novel, your Twitter feed might focus exclusively on little-known facts about romance, courtship and sex from the period you’re writing about.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Constancy.</strong> You build a platform like you build muscles: repeating the same activities over time. Once you have your strategy in place, put your head down and
          <em>work the plan</em>. Email, tweet, blog, speak, do interviews, repeat. Results won’t come right away, but don’t worry about that. Just keep going. Doing the right things again and again yields results.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Coordination.</strong> Your goal is to make your book
          <em>inevitable</em>—to make book buyers see it everywhere they look so that they think, “Man, that book is
          <em>everywhere</em>! I’ve got to read it.” To make that happen, coordinate your marketing activities. Schedule things like radio interviews, book signings, posters in the windows of local bookstores and email blasts so that they happen around the same time. It’s especially critical during the first 30 days after your book comes out.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Connection.</strong> Know what your readers care about and connect with them about those subjects. If you’ve published a children’s book and you find that your audience really cares about bullying in school, have a substantial percentage of your tweets, updates and blog posts focus on that topic. Remember, sincerity, authenticity and genuine caring are the best way to sell.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="subA">Getting Traction</p>
      <p>That’s a pretty airy-fairy justification for this rule. So let’s get down to something more concrete: you need at least a year to build a bestseller-caliber platform because it takes time for every marketing tactic to get traction. What do we mean by
        <em>traction</em>? Think of your Twitter feed, for example. You launch a nicely designed Twitter account for your book and start tweeting ten, even 20 times every day. You pick up some followers and follow all the protocols: retweeting great tweets, replying to people who impress you, tweeting offers and links and other things of value. All good. But those tweets aren’t turning into book sales. You’re not “gripping and grabbing” many readers. Why?</p>
      <p>Because there are millions of people doing the same thing as you, silly! There are also dozens of social networks, blog networks and other diversions vying for people’s attention. You’re shouting to be heard in a world that’s brimming over with noise, and at first,
        <em>nobody can hear you</em>.</p>
      <p>Eventually, if you’re consistent and provocative and interactive, your Twitter numbers will grow and you’ll start to gain real fans on the network. You’ll start gripping the road and grabbing the attention of followers who
        <em>really care</em> about what you have to say and will investigate your book and actually buy it. But that takes time.</p>
      <p>The same principle plays out when you’re sending press releases, trying to get booked as a speaker, sending articles to newspapers and magazines, or trying to build the subscriber base for your blog or podcast. You’re competing against a world of distractions—including tens of thousands of other authors trying to get the attention of the same editors and blog surfers. True, most of those authors won’t know what they’re doing. They won’t have read this book. They’ll expect instant fame and they’ll screw up every part of building their platform.
        <em>But the editors and speaking bookers</em>
        <em>won’t know this right away</em>. They’ll assume you’re just another amateur hack and lump you in with the rest of the noise assault. Only by continuing to post and submit and reach out relentlessly—and by having a thoroughly professional and appealing brand—will you make them finally say, “Hey, this self-help author is actually a player. I should probably check out his website.”</p>
      <p>For example, according to Dan Zarrella of HubSpot, the average press release submitted by a service like PRWire gets seen by a journalist about 275 times in the week after its release. So why aren’t authors who submit strong press releases raking in the sales? Because seeing one press release means
        <em>nothing</em>. You’ve got to keep submitting, writing, podcasting, and emailing at a high level to overcome people’s inherent “So What Factor”, or SWF.</p>
      <p class="subA">Volume, Volume, Volume</p>
      <p>As success mentor and coach Michael Hyatt says, “Everyone is an expert at something. The problem is that we are unaware of it—or take it for granted. The key is to discover it and step into it. What is
        <em>your</em> expertise? You aren’t doing the world any favors by minimizing your expertise or trying to deny it.”</p>
      <p>Whether you’re publishing fiction or nonfiction, your audience wants to see you as an expert. If you’re writing nonfiction, you’re the expert in financial planning, home renovation or weight loss. If you’re writing fiction, you’re the expert in your characters and the world you’ve created. Either way, expertise helps your platform. But you’re more likely to be perceived as an expert when you have a volume of blog posts, articles, and podcast episodes showcasing your knowledge of your topic.</p>
      <p>Building up a catalog of posts and articles takes time. Even if you blog three times a week (something most of my authors swear they can’t possibly do), you’re still looking at six months before you have a critical mass of rich content that readers can sift through.</p>
      <p class="subA">You Got Game</p>
      <p>The last reason to begin building your platform long before your book hits shelves is simple: it’s going to take time for you to hit your stride as a blogger, Facebook whiz or speaker. Marketing is a skill like any other, and you’ll need to knock out a lot of blogs to develop a style that’s powerful and concise. You’ll need practice to become adept at the perfect 140-character tweet, and you’ll need lots of time in front of a mirror to nail down that 45-minute keynote speech, not to mention a bunch of drafts with a speechwriter.</p>
      <p>In short, craft comes slowly, and there’s no way to speed it up. That’s doubly true if, like a lot of writers, you’re just getting used to the idea of being a marketer. That’s a steep learning curve, and you’re going to have to learn a long list of skills: email marketing, calling to book speaking engagements, having a three-minute book talk for when you’re a guest on radio shows or podcasts, organizing your own book your if that floats your boat, and so on. Give yourself time to get up to speed.</p>
      <p class="subA">When to Start</p>
      <p>So if sound platform building means starting long before your book is done, how early do you start? As with all things, that depends. Because there are so many potential pieces to a platform, we’ve broken them down into six basic categories so we can talk timing more simply.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Publishing </em>refers to anything where you’re publishing your work in a medium where others can read or see it: your blog, guest blogging, LinkedIn, newspapers, magazines, your own podcast, or your own YouTube channel.</li>
        <li>
          <em>Internet </em>refers to anything online that’s not social media: your website, direct email, Google AdWords buys, online advertising, search engine optimization and so on.</li>
        <li>
          <em>Social </em>refers to any social networking platform: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Goodreads, etc.</li>
        <li>
          <em>Media</em> refers to anything that involves audio or video: traditional TV and radio, streaming TV like NetFlix, podcasts, YouTube and Vimeo videos.</li>
        <li>
          <em>Relationships </em>refers to alliances you make with influential people (celebrities, authors, politicians, corporate executives, etc.) or organizations (companies, churches, non-profits, universities, professional or fraternal associations).</li>
        <li>
          <em>Appearances </em>refers to anyplace you show up live: speaking engagements, workshops, book signings, round tables, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The rule of thumb is that you should start building your platform yesterday. But you only have so much time, money and energy, so you’ve got to be choosy. By and large, start with the most important piece of your
        <em>Internet</em> piece: your website (which will of course house your blog and YouTube channel). Your site is ground zero for your brand, so it has to be brilliant. Get a professional developer (do
        <em>not</em> do it yourself, even to save money) working on it at least a year from your publishing date (or “pub date”). Your site is where everyone will go after they read your articles or see your tweets, so it’s got to be done before you do anything else.</p>
      <p>Apart from being the place people go to read your blog, your site will also host another critical component of your Internet marketing, your email list. Email is an incredibly powerful marketing tool, and your site’s job is to build your list. How? By inviting people to subscribe to your blog, offering them exclusive previews of coming chapters, or offering discounts and contests when your book comes out. Or just by being really cool and awesome and making them want to hear from you regularly. Everything you do should be able building the list, building the list. Then, once it’s built, don’t screw it up by bombarding people with spam. One cool, beautiful e-newsletter a week is plenty. For a wonderful (if insanely ambitious) example, see
        <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org">www.brainpickings.org</a>.</p>
      <p>With your site done, start your
        <em>Social </em>and
        <em>Publishing</em> efforts next, at least nine months out from pub date. You’re going to need plenty of time to build an audience on platforms like Facebook that don’t have a lot of tolerance for overt selling. You’re also going to need time to build up a critical mass of blog posts. Nobody’s interested in somebody who’s only blogged four times; you seem like a noob. You want your blog to appear populated with lots of rich, interesting content; that can take weeks or months, depending on how fast and how often you write.</p>
      <p>If you want to create your own podcast or YouTube channel to host a video blog, start this early as well. For one thing, podcasting or shooting decent quality video takes some equipment and some technical knowhow. For another, it takes time to build an audience. Start early and you give yourself that time.</p>
      <p>The part of publishing that takes the longest is getting picked up by other blogs and by newspapers or magazines. That can take months of steady submissions to sites like the Huffington Post or even your local daily newspaper. You’re figuring out what they want and tailoring your style for them, and that means practice, practice, practice. Think Carnegie Hall.</p>
      <p class="Pro-Tip">
        <span class="Pro-Tip-Head">Pro Tip:</span> Before submitting articles, essays or other work to any periodical or website, get their Submission Guidelines. They’ll tell you what they’re looking for and how they want it submitted, so you’re less likely to waste your time or theirs.</p>
      <p>Next, start working on
        <em>Relationships</em>, perhaps six months out from publication. Why wait? If you’re going to be asking influential people or corporate leaders to endorse your book, invite you to speak or support your marketing, you’re going to need to show them some substantial material. If you’ve already got dozens of blog posts live online, several articles or stories in legit magazines, and a killer website, they’re going to take you a lot more seriously. Start by making a list of the people you want to reach out to, hone your pitch and your “ask” (what you want them to do) and start calling or sending emails.</p>
      <p>Start working on
        <em>Appearances </em>about the same time, for the same reason. You’re going to be contacting writer’s conferences, TED venues, universities and other possible speaking venues about being a speaker, and you need to show them that you’re not some wannabe author. You’re a lot more likely to get calls returned if you have a substantial body of work already out there on LinkedIn, HuffPost and your own blog.</p>
      <p class="Pro-Tip">
        <span class="Pro-Tip-Head">Pro Tip:</span> To bolster your credibility with organizations, have a finished cover design that you can email them as a PDF. You’ll have to know your final title and hire a professional designer, but it’s worth it to package yourself as a bona fide author whose book is just about to come out. A cover makes you legit.</p>
      <p>Finally, begin pursuing
        <em>Media</em> leads about three months out. Most radio and TV programs won’t book first-time authors before their books come out, so closer is better. The same is true for being a guest on someone else’s podcast. By this time, you’ll need to have a professional-quality press kit to send to producers and program directors.</p>
      <p class="subA">How Long Things Should Take</p>
      <p>Oh, if only there were a hard and fast rule for how long it takes for a blog to go viral or for that first $20,000 speaking gig to roll in! Sorry, there’s not. The best we can do is give you some very, very broad guidelines. Still, it’s good to keep some general time frames in mind. So we’ll say this: if you have been working consistently on your platform and hit one of these milestones with little or no results, you’re probably doing it wrong and need to regroup. Hey, kids! Let’s generalize!</p>

      </table>
      <p></p>
      <p>Of course, the most important thing you can do is to start, even if you start slowly. Writing a book means you have a wealth of what’s called
        <strong>
          <em>actionable intellectual property,</em> or actionable IP. </strong>Actionable IP is any original content—characters, storylines, self-help processes, labels like “The Tipping Point”—that’s interesting and that people might want to read about or hear about. Even if your book’s not done, you’ve created some actionable IP, even if it’s just your rich, memorable private detective character. That’s where your marketing begins.</p>
      <p>You know who else cares about your platform? Book buyers. Having presented hundreds of titles to buyers at Barnes &amp; Noble, Books-a-Million, and Costco (to name just a few), Naren can tell you that in today’s marketplace book buyers, particularly at national chains, are more interested in statistics than your average baseball fan (and that’s saying something). How many Twitter followers do you have? How about Instagram? How many Facebook fans? What about media hits, events, book tours, and blogging traction? Interestingly enough, buyers want to know every detail about an author’s platform, but rarely do they ask about the book’s content itself these days.</p>
      <p>Think about that for a second. That’s how important platform is.</p>
