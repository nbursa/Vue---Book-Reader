        How to Sell a Crapload of Books
      </h1>
      <p class="bookDescription body article font2">In How to Sell a Crapload of Books, Tim Vandehey, New York Times bestselling ghostwriter, and Naren Aryal, CEO and Publisher of Mascot Books, share 10 secrets about building a killer marketing platform that nobody else is talking about.

Today, being an author is about professionalism and determination, cleverness and creativity, technological savvy and old-fashioned hustle. If you want to sell books, get a publishing deal or even turn writing into a full-time career, you have to be a marketer, not just a writer. Let Tim and Naren show you how.</p>
